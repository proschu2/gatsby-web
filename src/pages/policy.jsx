    <p>
      We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our
      Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements,

      <strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
      Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
      preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
      this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
      been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
      mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
      for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
      that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short: </strong>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with
      relevant laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by
      an updated &quot;Revised&quot; date at the top of this privacy notice. If we make material
      changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of
      such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
      privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
